      You might discover that you need to discuss the different aspects of math.
      Mathematics is the study of numbers, structures, space and change as well
      as the application of each. Math is more than adding and subtracting;
      math is spatial relationships, measuring and probability.

      You can help youth evaluate the impact of math on our lives by exploring
      the ways we use math each day. Ask youth to brainstorm how they have used
      math in the past day. Let youth brainstorm by themselves for a little bit,
      then try to stimulate their mind with ideas. Have them recall everything
      they did for a full 24 hours, including when they were sleeping.
      Do you think math is fun?
